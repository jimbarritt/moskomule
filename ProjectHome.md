<div>
The mule will take care of all kinds of usful tasks for you.<br>
<br>
He is primarly aimed at the web developer who often finds himself carrying large loads of xml from the classpath to his tests, or trying to test a response from a server.<br>
<br>
The mule not only knows about XML, but also will at some point know about JSON too.<br>
<br>
He provides a simple API for templating responses.<br>
<br>
He uses heavily XmlUnit, Junit and the Java XML parsing capabilities.<br>
<br>
He hopes also one day to learn dot.net and do the same thing there.<br>
<br>
He is influenced in style by his sister, <a href='http://mockito.org'>Mockito</a>
